## Xenko and vvvv

When Xenko went fully open-source in 2018, one of my intent was to be able to engage directly with some of Xenko most enthusiast customers and power users would be great. [vvvv](https://vvvv.org/) is definitely a perfect example.

[vvvv](https://vvvv.org/) is a hybrid visual/textual live-programming environment for easy prototyping and development.

vvvv has been using Xenko under the hood for a while, e.g. for the [Ocean of Air](https://forums.xenko.com/t/multi-user-vr-done-with-xenko-we-live-in-an-ocean-of-air/1872) project.

There's also various plans to leverage Xenko even further in their future [gamma version](https://vvvv.org/blog/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview).

That's what led me to establish closer contact with them. At some point, in May 2019, I jumped in with both feets and moved to Berlin. They've been graciously sponsoring Xenko and allowed me to use their office since then.

My sincere thanks to them for supporting Xenko and me!

## Code signing certificates

A few days ago, Xenko code signing certificate expired, leaving the project in a tough situation where smooth releases are not possible anymore.

[vvvv](https://vvvv.org/) graciously offered me to temporarily sign Xenko official releases with their own codesign certificate. So don't be surprised to see their name popping up next time you upgrade Xenko!

This is only temporary and we are working to get our own code signing certificate as soon as possible. More to come soon on that front!
